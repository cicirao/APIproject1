My favourite Music Style
------------------------
    My project 1 shows some statistics for the English songs I have heard in last week.(Data provided 
    by douban.fm) And by showing that list, it finds my favourite music style.
    All the showed data come from JSON, or worked JSON data.
    
    During the process of presenting data in the browser, I manipulated them by DOM: to get the HTML 
    node, append child node, change the inner HTML or other attributes. Also, I've tried to use 
    "querySelector" to get the node, and I succeed at last.
    
    I also use some method: Math.max(), when finding the favourite style.
    When adding songs to the list, I've tried to use high-order function. It's fun and can make my 
    function concise. But I failed. I'm trying to figure out why and modify the code.
    
    So, although it looks like I've achieve my goal, it still need some improvement.

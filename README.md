My favourite Music Style
------------------------
    My project 1 shows some statistics for the English songs I have heard in last week.(Data provided by 
    douban.fm) And by showing that list, it finds my favourite music style.
    All the showed data come from JSON, or worked JSON data.
    
    During the process of presenting data in the browser, I manipulated them by DOM: to get the HTML node,
    append child node, change the inner HTML or other attributes. Also, I've tried to use "querySelector" 
    to get the node. I know the code could be easier by using "querySelector", but I failed.
    
    I also use some method: Math.max(), when finding the favourite style.
    When adding songs to the list, I use high-order function. It's fun and can make my function concise. 
    But I just succeed half. I'm trying to figure out why. I just write a fucntion contains a part of the 
    reused code. But for the other part, if I replace them with a function, that couldn't work. So I'm 
    still trying to modify the code.
    
    So, although it looks like I've achieve my goal. It still need some improvement.
